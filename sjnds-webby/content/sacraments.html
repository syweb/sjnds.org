  <p>SJNDS provides frequent opportunities for the reception of the sacraments. During the
  second grade, children prepare for and receive both the Sacraments of Reconciliation
  and Eucharist. During the eighth grade, students prepare for and receive the Sacrament
  of Confirmation. During Advent and Lent students in grades 3-8 have the opportunity to
  receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation.</p>
