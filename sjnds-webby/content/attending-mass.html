<p>Religious worship is an integral part of a child’s growth and a central part of our school’s Catholic identity. Every Friday the school attends Mass which is student-led.  The children participate in every aspect of the Mass: as lectors, altar servers, and choir members. Some faculty members are trained as Eucharistic Ministers and participate in the school Masses as well. Families are welcomed and encouraged to celebrate these liturgies with the school community. We celebrate special feast days throughout the year.</p>
  <p>Prayer is an important part of SJNDS. In the morning we gather as a school community and ask for Christ’s guidance. Throughout the day students have opportunities to pray personally or as a class. SJNDS also holds a weekly Wednesday all school prayer service which includes the gospel reading of the day, reflection on the message, and character development. </p>
