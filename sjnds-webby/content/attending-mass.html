<p>Religious worship is an integral part of a child’s growth and a central part of our school’s
  Catholic identity. Every Friday the school attends Mass which is student-led. The
  children participate in every aspect of the Mass: as lectors, altar servers, and choir
  members. Some faculty members are trained as Eucharistic Ministers and participate in
  the school Masses as well. Families are welcomed and encouraged to celebrate these
  liturgies with the school community.</p>
  <p> SJNDS also holds a weekly Wednesday all school prayer service which includes the
  gospel reading of the day, reflection on the message, and character development. We
  celebrate special feast days throughout the year. On the Feast of St. Francis, students
  bring their pets to school for a special blessing. On All Saints Day, the students dress up
  as and present a short biography of their chosen Saint. We celebrate the true meaning
  of Christmas with a school-wide Christmas Pageant that retells the story of Christ’s birth.
  During Lent, the students participate in the Stations of the Cross every week with the
  eighth grade class presenting their live version of Good Friday. In May, we have a
  traditional May Crowning.</p>
