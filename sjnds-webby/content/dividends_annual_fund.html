  <p><strong>Annual Fund</strong></p>
  <p>The focus for this year's "Dividends for Life" annual fund will be Athletics.  It is our goal to replace all four basketball goal areas on the playground and to purchase a new scoreboard for the Parish Hall.  Additional funds will be used to support other programs where the need is greatest.</p>
  <p>
    Pledge cards will be sent home through the Family Envelope on November 10.  Turn in pledge cards at our "interesting" carline on Friday, November 19.
