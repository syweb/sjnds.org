<h4>  Hot Lunch Program</h4>
<p>  SJNDS offers a hot lunch program delivered by local businesses every full day of school.
  A lunch calendar is sent home monthly and orders are placed and paid for ahead of
  time.
</p>
<p>  Milk and juice are available for purchase separately at the beginning of the school year.
  Students who do not order hot lunch must bring lunches from home. We encourage
  parents to make certain that these lunches are healthy.
</p>
