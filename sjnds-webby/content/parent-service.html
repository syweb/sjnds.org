  <p>In order for the Parents’ Club to meet its financial obligation to the school, each
  family must earn 40 points (minimum 10 points in fund-raising) in the Parent
  Involvement Program (PIP) for the period May 1st through April 30. Only Parents’
  Club sanctioned events/functions will earn credit toward the PIP Point System. PIP
  Points can be earned by purchasing Scrip according to the schedule published prior
  to registration. In order for the Parents’ Club to meet its financial obligation to the
  school, children will not be registered for the following year if the commitments
  agreed to in the Tuition/Parent Involvement Program Contract for the current year
  are not fulfilled.</p>
