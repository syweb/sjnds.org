  <p>Our sixth annual summer school program, available to all students in the community, is open to students entering Kindergarten through eighth grade in fall 2011.  This summer students will play, work, and make new friends in a Catholic community where they will experience fun, challenging, and exciting courses.</p>
  <p>It is our aim to offer classes that will build upon student experiences at school and at play, as well as opportunities for students to share their talents. Our two unique sessions will include a structured timetable of academic work, enrichment classes, sports activities and social events. We are sure our students will make lots of new friends and take home lasting memories.</p>
    <p>Class sections are scheduled between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., with extended day care available from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Additionally, we have developed a “build your own” session. If you would like to handcraft your summer experience out of the 6 weeks offered, you may do so. </p>
      <p>Please feel free to <strong>call (916) 985-4548 or e-mail <a href="mailto:dbrandenburg@sjnds.com">dbrandenburg@sjnds.com</a></strong> with your questions. We hope you will join us in 2011 at SJNDS Summer School, where you can enjoy the experience for yourself.</p>
