    We give our students many opportunities to be active participants in the celebration of
    the Mass. One very special way SJNDS boys and girls have to take part in the Mass is
    by altar service. Beginning in the third grade, all children are invited to train as an altar
    server. The training is done under the supervision of a volunteer member of the parish.
    Students are then encouraged to serve at both school and parish Masses.
