  <p>The curriculum at SJNDS strives to teach every student the skills necessary not only to learn within our walls but also in the community and beyond eighth grade. The curriculum is integrated between subjects and sequenced between grades so that the learning process is seamless, and students easily transition to the next subject and next grade. The curriculum follows the standards set by the Diocese of Sacramento which meet or exceed California State Standards.</p>
  <p>Students receive grade appropriate instruction in religion, reading, English/language arts, math, social studies, Spanish, science, physical education and art. All students spend time in the computer lab learning computer skills.</p>
  <p>Physical education is part of SJNDSâ€™ required curriculum. This program is taught by a full-time P.E. teacher who provides active and challenging classes for each grade level. Students participate in gross motor movement, learn the rules of organized playground and court games, and are encouraged to be physically active in their lives.</p>
  <p>In addition to rigorous studies, other activities include Student Council, California Junior Scholarship Federation, and Parochial Athletic League.</p>
