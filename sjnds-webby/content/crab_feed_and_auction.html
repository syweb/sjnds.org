  <p><strong>Crab Feed and Auction</strong></p>
  <p>
 Ride on into town, folks, ‘cause It’s time for the event of the year, Denim and Diamonds! Y’all don’t want to miss The Crab Feed and Auction, one of our biggest fundraisers at St. John Notre Dame School.  First is the best chow this side of the Mississippi, from the homemade minestrone soup to the endless servings of crab, our finger licken’ food will fill you right up. And let’s not forget our full service adult “watering hole” to wet your adult whistle. On the way into the party, swing on through the Silent Auction and mark your sweet little “x” next to some homespun gifts and one of a kind treats. On the way into the big shindig, make sure you hit the “Super Silent” table which includes some awful big goodies which got wedged out of the Live Auction.  Then the foot stompin’ thigh slappin’ fun begins! Wanna travel? Bid on the Park City getaway for a week, dinner show in San Francisco , or golfing in North Carolina.  And these are just some of the yahoo, gitty-up items waitin’ for your bid. Finally, guys grab your girls and dosey-do right to the dance floor, and enjoy swingin’ your hips to the music of  our very own local band, AZUAR. Their music from the 70’s to the present will bring pleasure to your ears.  Don’t hold back, y’all. Get your reservation form filled out and sent in ($60.00 a person with 10 to a table), so you can come on down an’ enjoy the best fun tootin’ event of the year, Denim and Diamonds! Our event starts with a No Host Bar at 5:00 p.m.
