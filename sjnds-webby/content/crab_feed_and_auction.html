  <p><strong>Crab Feed and Auction</strong></p>
  <p>
  It’s time for the event of the year! The Crab Feed and Auction is one of our biggest fundraisers at St. John Notre Dame School.  An event you don’t want to miss.  From the great menu we have, starting with the homemade minestrone soup to the endless serving or crab.  Don’t forget about our full bar with great wine offerings.  Before and during dinner while enjoying some great wine, don’t forget to visit our Silent Auction Tables.  This year we have a new Table called Super Silent which includes all the big ticket items that did not make it on our Live Auction list.  With that being said our Live Auction has some great items on it.  A Park City getaway for a week, to a dinner show in San Francisco to Golfing in North Carolina.  The list is endless with choices you’re going to love to have at an Auction like this. After our Live Auction is done, enjoy dancing and music by our local band AZUAR. The music is the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s and current. Something for everyone. A reservation form is available for you to fill out and send in for a seat.  Our event starts with a No Host Bar at 5:00 p.m. The price is $60.00 a person with 10 to a table.
