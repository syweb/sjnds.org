  <p>SJNDS participates in a SCRIP fundraising program to help raise additional money for
  our school.</p>
  <p>Scrip generates over $80,000 each year in profit! Here’s how:</p>
  <ul>
  
  <li>Scrip is a gift certificate used instead of cash or check to purchase merchandise
  at most grocery stores, restaurants, specialty shops, gasoline stations, home
  improvement and department stores and to pay on charge accounts at certain
  department stores.</li>
  
  <li>The stores sell the Scrip to the school at a discount. By selling it to you at face
  value, Scrip costs you no additional money yet the school makes $2-10 on every
  $100 you purchase.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>Scrip is sold during the school year via the family envelope system, at EDP on
  Thursdays, in the car line on Fridays, in the school office, and at all weekend
  Masses at St. John the Baptist Church. During the summer, Scrip is sold before
  and after all weekend Masses at St. John the Baptist Church and in the school
  office.</p>
  <p>The school also earns money through eSCRIP programs with local grocery stores. As a
  way of giving back to their communities, the stores donate a percentage of customer
  purchases to a designated recipient. You can register your Safeway Club Card, Macy’s
  charge card or ATM charge card and designate SJNDS as the recipient of a percentage
  of your shopping purchase amount.</p>
  <p>Friends and family may also register their grocery store cards and designate St. John
  Notre Dame School in Folsom as the recipient of their shopping credits. These include
  the free Quality of Life Card from Raley’s/Bel Air and the Nugget Scrip card.
  Every year the SCRIP and eSCRIP programs provide the school with additional funds
  that are used in a variety of ways to enrich the educational experience of our students.
  SCRIP and eSCRIP are easy to participate in, raise much-needed monies for the school,
  and are not an additional expense for the participants.</p>
