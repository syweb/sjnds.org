  <p>SJNDS participates in a SCRIP fundraising program to help raise additional money for
  our school.</p>
  <p>Scrip generates over $80,000 each year in profit! Here’s how:</p>
  <ul>
  
  <li>Scrip is a gift certificate used instead of cash or check to purchase merchandise
  at most grocery stores, restaurants, specialty shops, gasoline stations, home
  improvement and department stores and to pay on charge accounts at certain
  department stores.</li>
  
  <li>The stores sell the Scrip to the school at a discount. By selling it to you at face
  value, Scrip costs you no additional money yet the school makes $2-10 on every
  $100 you purchase.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>

  <p>
  Every year the SCRIP and eSCRIP programs provide the school with additional funds
  that are used in a variety of ways to enrich the educational experience of our students.
  SCRIP and eSCRIP are easy to participate in, raise much-needed monies for the school,
  and are not an additional expense for the participants.</p>
