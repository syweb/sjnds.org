  <p>Prospective students are considered for acceptance at SJNDS based on the following
  priorities:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Families with siblings currently enrolled who are registered, active parishioners;</li>
    <li>Families who are registered, active parishioners and who are or who have been concurrently on the waiting list;</li>
    <li>Catholic students transferring from another Catholic school;</li>
    <li>Families who are registered, active parishioners and are new to St. John Notre  Dame School;</li>
    <li>Active Catholic families from neighboring parishes;</li>
    <li>Non-Catholic families.</li>
  </ol>
  <p></p>
<p>  To be considered a parishioner and be entitled to receive the parishioner tuition rate
  one must have been enrolled in St. John the Baptist Parish for a minimum of one
  year prior to the start date of that child. Students applying for transfer into the school
  will be tested/assessed (prior to admittance in the school) to insure appropriate
  placement in the instructional program and to insure that the school can meet the potential studentâ€™s learning needs. Students applying for transfer from outside the
  Catholic school system for the eighth grade will not be accepted. All new students
  will be admitted on probationary status for one year from the date of enrollment to
  ensure proper adjustment to our school environment and curriculum.</p>
<p>  A child who is 5 years of age on or before September 1st of the current school year
  may apply for Kindergarten; a child who is 6 years of age on or before September
  1st of the current school year may apply for 1st grade. All children will be assessed
  for readiness regardless of age.</p>
<p>  Registration is held each year in the spring. Students who leave the school will not
  be given priority if they decide to return later. Final acceptance is determined by the
  pastor and school administration.</p>
<p>  Please stop by the school office located at <strong>309 Montrose Drive, Folsom</strong>, to pick up an
  Admission Application Packet, or call <strong>916-985-4129</strong> and one will be mailed to you.</p>
