  <h4>Program</h4>
  <p>The SJNDS Kindergarten class has two groups, Early and Late: 8:05 a.m. to 11:40 a.m.
  and 9:15 a.m. to 1:20 p.m. The class has one credentialed teacher and two aides.</p>
  <p>  Our philosophy is that children are individuals with differing learning styles who should
  be appreciated for their uniqueness in an atmosphere full of rich experiences. It is our
  responsibility as educators to support each child's development through active
  involvement in the learning process.</p>
  <p>The Language Arts curriculum is child-centered and based on individual development
  accounting for differing learning styles and includes phonics, writing, reading, listening,
  and comprehension skills. We explore Mathematics using manipulatives, by playing
  games, and through experimentation. Additionally, the children have approximately 25
  minutes each day of Choice or Center Time. Kindergarten should be a positive and
  challenging experience for your children. It is a place where they will feel comfortable
  and build self-esteem. After all, this is the starting point for their scholastic education,
  and it is very important that they feel confident with themselves and comfortable in their
  environment.</p>
