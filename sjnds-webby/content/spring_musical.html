  <p><strong>Spring Musical</strong></p>
  <p>
  If there were Tony Awards for school plays, SJNDS would be a top nominee. Over 100 of our students participate each year in the musical. Come jeer Gaston, cheer Belle and the Beast and sing along with Lumiere and the dancing dinnerware. We have raffles, door prizes and so much more. You don’t just see the play, you experience it.
