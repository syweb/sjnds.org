<p>  An educational ministry of <a href="http://www.stjohnsfolsom.org" title="St. John the Baptist Catholic Church - Home">St. John the Baptist Catholic Church</a>, SJNDS emphasizes a
  religious foundation for all students. The Catholic faith is an academic subject in its own
  right, and it is also integrated into all other academic disciplines and school activities.
  We are one of the few diocesan schools with our own Campus Minister who leads us in
  community outreach and service ministries.</p>
  
  <p>The religion curriculum challenges students to participate in worship, act as part of a
  community, and realize that each person deserves love and respect. Students study
  scripture and learn Catholic doctrine. They prepare for the Sacraments of Reconciliation,
  Eucharist and Confirmation. Students are encouraged to respond to the needs of others,
  live peacefully and justly, and care for Godâ€™s creation.</p>
