  Department of the Diocese of Sacramento directs Parents’ Clubs to fulfill the
  following tasks in this order of importance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To promote open communication among the parents, teachers, and  administration to aid in all aspects of education, growth, and development</li>
  <li>To build community and cooperation among the parents, faculty, administration,  Advisory Commission, and the parish of SJNDS</li>
  <li>To direct and coordinate parental support to SJNDS through assistance activities, social functions, and fund-raisers.</li>
