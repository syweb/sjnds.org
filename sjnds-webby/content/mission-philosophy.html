<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>St. John Notre Dame Catholic School (Jr. K through 8) is the primary educational ministry of St. John the Baptist Parish of the Diocese of Sacramento. We are a faith community committed to learning and serving with Christ. We provide a quality Catholic education for the parishioners of St. John the Baptist Parish through a culture of continuous improvement dedicated to academic excellence.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>St. John Notre Dame School exists to serve children. We strive to inspire lifelong learning to help our students mature into healthy people of faith, thought, integrity and action. We recognize parents as the primary educators of their children. Our goal is to help our students develop to their fullest potential as they begin to take their place as responsible Catholic citizens in our society.</p>
