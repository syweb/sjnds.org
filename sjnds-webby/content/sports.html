<p>  The aim of SJNDS is to give every boy and girl an opportunity to participate in a varied
  athletic program. Students in grades 5-8 may participate in the Parochial Athletic
  League (P.A.L), an after school sports program. The P.A.L. is designed to promote
  good sportsmanship, develop physical coordination and give the participants the
  opportunity to meet and enjoy new friends and, in doing so, enrich their lives.
  Participants in this program are representatives of our school and their conduct and
  sportsmanship must be representative of a SJNDS student.
  Volunteers for coaching make extracurricular athletics possible. All volunteers are
  expected to follow school policies and guidelines.
