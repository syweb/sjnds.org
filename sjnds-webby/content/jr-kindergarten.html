  <h4>Program</h4>
  <p>Program
  The SJNDS Jr. Kindergarten class meets Monday through Thursday 9:00 a.m. to 12:00
  p.m. and Friday 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. The class has two full-time teachers.</p>
  <p>Our philosophy is that young children need to be socially ready to participate in a
  classroom setting in order to learn. Young children vary in learning styles, and come to
  us at different stages of development. We feel it is our responsibility as educators to
  recognize these stages and provide children with an enriching environment. It is also our
  responsibility to provide them with the skills needed to work with others and express
  themselves in a safe and fun Catholic environment.</p>
  <p>
    In order to prepare them for a classroom setting, the students will participate in
    cooperative play, practice self control by sitting quietly and attentively at circle time, and
    develop fine motor coordination. We will introduce <em>Handwriting Without Tears</em>, a
    developmental handwriting program geared to taking away the frustration of handwriting
    for young children. We will also integrate <em>Zoophonics</em> which emphasizes phonics for
    reading. The <em>Seeds</em> program will instruct the children following the weekly Gospel. We
    will use manipulatives for counting and basic math; will work on gross motor skills
    through art and play; will look at science through the seasons, plant life, living creatures
    and the weather; and will use art to work on fine and gross motor development and self
    expression. We will also integrate social studies by learning about the different
    members of our community and how we fit into our community.
