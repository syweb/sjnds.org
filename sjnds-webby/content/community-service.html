    <blockquote><small>“Since the Gospel message is one of peace, love, patience and respect for
    others...Today’s Catholic schools must respond to these challenges by developing in its
    students a commitment to community and to the social skills and virtues needed to
    achieve it.”
      <br /><small>&mdash;To Teach As Jesus Did, A Pastoral message on Catholic Education</small>
    </small></blockquote>
    <p>All grades participate in a class service project chosen by the students. Our
    Kindergartners make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for Loaves and Fishes. The
    fourth graders sing monthly for a local convalescent home, while our eighth graders
    serve our brothers and sisters at Loaves and Fishes. Middle school students have a
    further responsibility to community service as a component of their religion classes.
