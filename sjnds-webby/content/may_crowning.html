  <p><strong>May Crowning </strong></p>
  <p>
    
    At the 8:15 a.m. Mass, students honor Mary, the mother of God, at the annual Crowning of Our Blessed Mother. Students pay reverence to the Queen Mother with a beautiful, flowerfilled procession into the church. Our second-grade class, who would have recently received their Holy Communion sacrament, come splendidly dressed in their Holy Communion attire. Our eighth-graders honor Mary with a procession and one student crowns Mary.
