  <p>St. John Notre Dame Catholic School is a Jr. Kindergarten through eighth grade coeducational Catholic school located in Folsom, California. We, a ministry of St. John the Baptist Parish and the Diocese of Sacramento, are fully accredited by the Western Catholic Educational Association (WCEA) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). </p>
  <p>Academic excellence and a strong faith foundation are the hallmarks of an SJNDS education. The students are challenged not only to meet the highest academic standards, but also to learn and serve with Christ. In addition to a challenging curriculum that is aligned with Diocesan standards, we offer a wide enrichment program which includes art, technology, Spanish, and athletics.</p>
