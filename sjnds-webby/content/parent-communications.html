  <p>Parent communication is important at SJNDS. The faculty strives to keep families
  informed of current events and activities in the classrooms.</p>
  <p>SJNDS utilizes a weekly Family Envelope system for communication between school
  and parents/guardians and a weekly e-mailed newsletter. Each Thursday the Family
  Envelope is sent home with the youngest or only student in each family and should be
  returned to school by the following day.</p>
