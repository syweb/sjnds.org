<p>The following programs are available at SJNDS.</p>
<h4>CJSF</h4>

<p>The California Junior Scholarship Federation, an affiliate of the California Scholarship
Federation (high school level), is a statewide organization which is also affiliated with the
Association of California School Administrators. </p>

<p>Students in 7th and 8th grade must apply for membership within the first two weeks of
each trimester. An important responsibility of this group is service.
They facilitate a monthly canned food drive for our local food bank and coordinate a
yearly school supply drive for Nicaraguan students.</p>
<h4>Student Council</h4>
<p>One of the primary objectives of Catholic education is to develop Christian leadership.
Responsibilities of citizenship are an important part of the studentsâ€™ education. Through
their participation on the Student Council, students learn responsibility, share school
spirit, and develop leadership skills. The student government program also provides
service to the school, church, and community. Student Council is comprised of elected
members from 6th through 8th grade and class representatives from 5th through 8th
grades.</p>
<h4>Robotics</h4>
<p>SJNDS has joined the F.I.R.S.T. Lego League (FLL) which competes with other schools. F.I.R.S.T. is an acronym for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
Technology. Each September students are provided with a challenge, which is
composed of two parts. The first part is a project which is based on real world problems
that scientists face today. Students must create, design and present their plan. The
second part is the robot game, where students design and program a Lego robot to do a
number of particular tasks.
</p>
<h4>Academic Decathlon</h4>
<p>Academic Decathlon consists of a team of students who compete against other schools
in particular categories: math, science, literature, grammar, social studies, and a super
quiz.
</p><h4>Religious Decathlon</h4>
<p>The students demonstrate knowledge of their faith in the following categories: Beatitutdes, prayers, Mass and the catechism of the Catholic church. The students compete in an individual written test, a group challenge and a group super quiz.</p>
