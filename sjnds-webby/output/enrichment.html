  <p>SJNDS is proud to provide enrichment classes to Grades 1-8. They are intended to
  enhance and enrich the classroom curriculum while fully engaging students through their
  different learning modalities.</p>
<h4>  Spanish</h4>
  <p>Foreign language instruction is offered to all students at SJNDS. The Spanish teacher
  focuses on conversational Spanish.</p>
  <h4>Technology</h4>
<p>  SJNDS is proud to offer a self-contained computer lab. The computer teachers work with
  the classroom teachers to develop meaningful projects for students to perform while
  learning critical computer skills.
  Students have computer classes weekly. Students learn age appropriate basic to
  advanced computer skills. It is our goal to make them feel comfortable and confident
  using technology. Our educational software is selected to enhance and enrich the
  classroom learning experience.
</p>
<h4>Art</h4>
  <p>Another wonderful endeavor at SJNDS is the art program. Our full-time talented teacher
  brings the gift of creativity and enthusiasm through a wide spectrum of mediums. Her
  goal is to develop student skills commencing with the elements of art and culminating
  with self expression.</p>
<h4>  Fine Arts</h4>
<p>  The educational experience at SJNDS does not end with basic academics. The creative
  spirit in each student is encouraged through a variety of artistic and creative
  opportunities including choir, art, and a spring musical. Choir and art students enter in
  community exhibits and competitions. The spring musical brings out the talent of more
  than 100 students including actors, singers, set designers, student directors, and
  technical crew members. Our musicals have been awarded community grants which
  help fund future endeavors.
</p>
<h4>  Field Trips</h4>
<p>  Field trips are designed to supplement and enrich the classroom curriculum. SJNDS
  students attend a number of educational field trips related to their studies in social
  studies, the arts, and science. Along with teachers and instructional aides, parent
  volunteers provide supervision on field trips.
  The 6th graders attend a weeklong outdoor science camp at the Marin Headlands, while
  the 8th graders attend the Yosemite Institute.
